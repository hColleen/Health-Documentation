        <div id = "intro"><p>The puprose of this tool is to help you communicate with your healthcare providers (HCPs) regarding your illness. Sometimes, due to time or mental fog/fatigue, you might not be able to fully communicate with your HCPs how your illness effects you on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>To help with this, below you'll find a link to a personal inventory that will allow you to choose which general activities you participate in (hobbies, chores, pet/service animal care, and work) and allow you to indicate whether you can do these things on a bad day or a good day.</p>
        <p>Below that, there will be a daily log that will allow you to easily log how your day was, including scales for pain, fatigue, energy, how you slept, and a free text box for you to add any notes that you want, such as what you did, if you took a nap and how long it was, etc.  You will be able to save these as an image or a PDF.  You can then share these files with your HCPs any way you prefer.</p></div>
