# Health Documentation Help
This project will be designed to help thos of us with chronic illness communicate with their healthcare providers and carers (if desired) about how they're doing on a daily basis, making sure things are documented if you are going through applying for disability.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to give people with chronic illness an easy way to document how well they're doing, and what they do on a day by day basis.  There will be a Personal Inventory that you can fill out once, or on a monthly basis, depending on how you feel about the answers you put in it and how your illness changes your overall health.  THere will also be a daily log that will give you a pain scale, fatigue scale, emotional scale, and a 'spoon' scale.  There will also be a free text area for journaling if you want to.

## Privacy
__*I will collect no information from you.*__  It will be stored on your device and I won't be pulling any data at all from you.  However, that being said, if your device is not secure or you show this to anyone else, that is outside my control.  If you are concerned that someone you don't particularly trust is going to spy on your device, I will do my best to implement a Save feature that allows you to password protect your file.  Once you give the information to your provider, it becomes part of your medical record and is, in the USA, then covered by HIPPA laws, which means you have control of who they share with (which is what the HIPPA releases doctors have you sign are for).  Even people under the age of 18 have the ability to have information put into their health record without their guardians being made aware of it.

If your HCP (healthcare provider) allows you to electronically send them information through a portal, this process is meant to be secure from end to end as long as you are logged into their system.  Be cautious sending information via email if you don't want others to be aware of this information.

If you chose to share feedback or suggestions about this tool, please don't send me any PII (personally identifying information) as, while I have no reason to share it, I'm not covered under HIPPA and would have to reveal any communications if I were to be called on by an authority to do so (though, I have an iffy definition of 'authority' that only includes HCPs, lawyers, and judges).  I welcome your suggestions and feedback, just keep in mind that limitation.  I really want this tool to help others.

## Format
There will be two forms that you can fill out with this application:
### Personal Inventory
This is meant to be an overall inventory of what you can do broadly in a month.  On it will be a list of hobbies, chores, work, if you have a pet/service animal, how much care you can give your pet, a scale to indicate how much you can do on a bad day and how much on a good day.  There will be an optional field for emergency contacts as well, if you want to make use of it.  This emergency contact is for the person or people you call on when you need help or want some support.  There will be a check box if you want them added to your provider's list of emergency contacts with whatever HIPPA level of release you grant them.
### Weekly(ish) log
This will be mostly a series of scales to make it as easy to fill out as possible.  There will be a pain scale, a fatigue scale, an emotional scale for depression and anxiety, a 'spoon' scale for how much energy you started the day with, and a free-text area for anything else you want to add.  The scales will be written in plain English rather than faces since most of us with a chronic illness don't really have a full grasp of the difference between a 1 and a 5 and a 10.

## TODO

[] Create scale and free text areas for good and bad day
[] Add emergency contact(s) area and save button
[] Create pain scale
[] Create fatigue scale
[] Create emotional scales
[] Create spoon scale
[] Add free text area, date capture, and save button
[] Add secure save feature for both forms
[] Updates?

## Timeline
I cannot promise when this project will be complete as I'm a chronically ill person with other things I __must__ do as well as other things I want to do.

## Languages
This project will be written with the magic of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in English since those are the languages I'm most confident in.  Once finished, I'd be happpy to let other people translate it either by forking this project or sending me the translation.  Medical information is far too important and tricky to let Google Translate power through it, I think.
